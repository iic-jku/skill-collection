Helpful cadence skill scrips as inspiration for creating new ones.
* setCDFParam.il:
The script will open each schematic of each cell of a defined library and change some CDF parameters. Afterward, a check-and-save is done.
* generate_schematics.il:
The script will generate a schematic (with a resistor instance placed) for each cell in a defined library where an abstract view already exists.
* generate_SupplyPins.il:
The script will generate VDD and VSS pins in the schematic for each cell of a defined library.
* generateMetallDrawingFromPin.il:
The script will use the already opened layout view to generate a drawing layer over each pin layer.
* checkAndSaveCollection.il:
This is a collection of snippets for checkAndSave of symbol- schematic and functional-views.
